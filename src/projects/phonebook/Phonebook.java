/**
 * <p>{@link Phonebook} is an abstraction over phonebooks: databases of &lt; Full Name,
 * Phone Number&gt; pairs. It allows for <b>both</b> phone <b>and</b> name search, both in
 * <em>amortized constant</em> time. The efficiency of either search will be dependent on
 * the nature of the underlying hash table. No null entries are allowed. </p>
 *
 * <p>{@link Phonebook} only allows for <b>unique</b> Person / Phone pairs. That is, every person will have
 * <b>exactly one</b> phone number associated with them, and every phone number will be associated with
 * <b>exactly one</b> person. Study the implementation of this class to see for yourselves how this is attained by
 * interfacing with both internal hash tables. </p>
 *
 * <p>The Release Tests on the <a href ="https://submit.cs.umd.edu/">submit server</a> primarily test the methods of {@link Phonebook}
 * Since {@link Phonebook}'s methods rely on methods of {@link HashTable} instances, by parameterizing
 * {@link Phonebook} instances in all 3^2 = 9 possible ways, we can run the same tests against all of the hash
 * tables that you will have to implement. </p>
